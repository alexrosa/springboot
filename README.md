#Rezzy Raunt project

## Requirements
For building and running this project you'll need to:
* <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html">JDK.1.8</a>
* <a href="https://maven.apache.org/">Apache Maven</a>

## Running the application locally
We can run this Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the main method in the
RezzyRauntApplication class from your IDE.
Also you can use the Spring Boot Maven plugin like so:


```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
## Project Improvements:
* Refactoring the REST API improving the return messages.
* Refactoring the entire project. I know that I can build a better code;
* Include a cache system (Redis);
* Include a database(Elasticsearch, MongoDB or Cassandra)
* Include more tests to guarantee the business rules of the project.
